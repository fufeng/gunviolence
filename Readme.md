# Mathematica Notebook for "Too little, too late -- a dynamical systems model for gun-related violence and intervention"

This repository contains a Mathematica notebook designed to reproduce the results presented in the paper "Too little, too late -- a dynamical systems model for gun-related violence and intervention" by Feng Fu and Dan Rockmore at Dartmouth College.

## Overview

This project aims to provide an interactive and detailed exploration of the dynamical systems model described in the paper. The Mathematica notebook allows for detailed mathematical and computational (bifurcation) analysis of the study, offering insights into the complex dynamics of gun-related violence and the impacts of various interventions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the `stopgunviolence_v2.nb` file using Mathematica.

## Usage

The notebook is divided into various sections, each corresponding to different aspects and results of the paper. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the simulations and visualize the results.
